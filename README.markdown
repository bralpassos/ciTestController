ciTestController
================

This is a CodeIgniter Controller that has a nice output for CodeIgniter UnitTest library.

To use this Controller just copy the file 'tests.php' to your **controllers** directory and then add some methods name **\_test\_TEST\_NAME()**.

I want to keep this software in a single file, but if it grows bigger I'll think a way to split it into a controller and a view.

Using
-----

Instructions of use are in **tests.php**.
